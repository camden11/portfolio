    "I much of spent my last year in Boston volunteering with Brain Arts, an organization dedicated to supporting artists and musicians from marginalized communities, and nurturing the city’s arts scene as a whole. While working with Brain Arts, I developed two different CMS-based sites with React, Next.js, GraphQL and Takeshape CMS. I also served as the organization’s photography director, creating a system to organize the organization’s massive amount of photo content and managing a team of photographers to ensure that high quality photos were taken at all the org’s events."
