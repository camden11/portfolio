    "During my last semester at Northeastern, I worked full-time as a project lead for Scout, the universityâ€™s student-led design studio. As project lead, I managed a team of five designers and developers to carry out a variety of different design and development tasks for Mass Hike, a nonprofit organization based in Boston. Ultimately, we built the organization a full e-commerce platform, complete with and admin-side interface, as well as a CMS-based marketing website.",
