    "The diamond that was stolen held the code that melted water into letters spelling where it had been taken to. In fact, I had a vision of the numbers corresponding with the letters - “THE DIAMOND”. They're suspended like a prism splitting floodlight to poles of primary colors clawing the veil of the vacuum.
